0. strcat

Write a function that concatenates two strings.

Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strcat. Run man strcat to learn more.

1. strncat

Write a function that concatenates two strings.

Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
it will use at most n bytes from src; and
src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
Return a pointer to the resulting string dest
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strncat. Run man strncat to learn more.

2. strncpy

Write a function that copies a string.

Prototype: char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
Your function should work exactly like strncpy
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strncpy. Run man strncpy to learn more.

3. strcmp

Write a function that compares two strings.

Prototype: int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
Your function should work exactly like strcmp
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strcmp. Run man strcmp to learn more.

4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy

Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

Prototype: void reverse_array(int *a, int n);
Where n is the number of elements of the array


5. Always look up

Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

Prototype: char *string_toupper(char *);

6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes

Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.

Prototype: char *cap_string(char *);

7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody

Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.
