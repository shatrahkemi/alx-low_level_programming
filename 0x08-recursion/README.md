0x08-recursion more of factorials and iterative in c programming as shown below a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n);
If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1
FYI: The standard library provides a different function: sqrt. Run man sqrt to learn more.
